This project contains a set of Python scripts to control a set of individually addressable LEDs from an upright piano for the 2022 BEAM Exhibition in Eugene, Oregon.

The piano keys, when pressed, would initiate contact between two looped copper wires--one set per key. Each set of wires was soldered on the other end to the circuitboards of various video game controllers. Each controller was then plugged into a RaspberryPi, which processed the inputs via a set of hand-written drivers and affected the state of the lights on the piano.
